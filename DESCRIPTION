Chapter: Statistical Inference
Description: This app focuses on tests for proportions in a sports context 
    (basketball free throw shooting). The app illustrates how a change in the 
    population caused by filtering can change the results and also illustrates the 
    difference between p, p̂, and p<sub>0</sub>
LearningObjectives: c(
    "The student will learn to how a change in the population caused by filtering can change the test results for proportions.",
    "The student will learn to what is the difference between p, p̂, and p<sub>0</sub>."
